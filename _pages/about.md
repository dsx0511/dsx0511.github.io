I'm Shuxiao Ding (Name in Chinese: 丁舒啸), a PhD student in the Team Scene Understanding at [Mercedes-Benz Group AG](https://www.mercedes-benz.com/en/). as well as in the Computer Vision Group, [Department of Information Systems and Artificial Intelligence](https://www.iai.uni-bonn.de) of the [University of Bonn](https://www.uni-bonn.de/en/home), where I am supervised by [Prof. Dr. Juergen Gall](http://gall.cv-uni-bonn.de). 

Previously, I was a Master and Bachelor student at the [Karlsruhe Institute of Technology](https://www.kit.edu/english/), where I completed both of my theses at the [Department of Measurement and Control](https://www.mrt.kit.edu/english/index.php), supervised by [Prof. Dr.-Ing. Christoph Stiller](https://www.mrt.kit.edu/english/mitarbeiter_stiller.php).

My research interests lie in Machine Learning, Computer Vision and Autonomous Driving. In particular, my research focuses on solving various problems in the end-to-end autonomous driving system using Graph Neural Networks, such as Multi-Object Tracking.
